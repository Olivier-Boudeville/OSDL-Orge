Orge Places
===========

These are archetypes of places, that can be used in a wide range of stories.


In Towns
--------

These are the place where most commodities for characters in need can be found:

 - taverns offers drinks and meeting places, for example for over-the-counter quests, news exchanges or unofficial recruitment
 
 - banks allow to store character possessions relatively safely 
 
 - hospitals and clinics help restoring health and recovering from wounds and diseases
 
 - hotels and inns offer a place to sleep quietly, and to let party members left behind (not selected for a given action), but not everybody can afford them
 
 - city hall and information panels give access to public services and offers (ex: openly published job offers)

 - stores offer thematically sorted goods, with often a good choice; merchants are often difficult in bargaining
 
 - markets are ideal for haggling second-hand properties, if one does not fear to have its purse stolen

 - armories generally offer a wide range of average-quality weapons
 
 - mainstream guilds have local premises, secret or not, in most towns
 
 - religious places, like churches, cathedrals (including crypts), temples, etc., help accommodating with one's deity, if any
 
 - dormitories
 
 - teaching buildings (universities, schools, alchemy laboratory, etc.); ex: School of Magic 
 
 - boarding schools
 
 - canteens
 
 - casinos, in the largest towns only (cheating there is severely punished)
  
 - graveyard: crypts, tombs and graves

 - some towns have catacombs 
 
 - libraries are notably useful for scholars, for magic sciences and local history; some of them are actually said to be haunted and/or to contain hazardous writings
 
 - classical shops: bakeries, butchery, etc.
 
 - classical crafts: weaving fabric, sawmill, windmill, forge, etc.
 
 - utility buildings: barn, attic, shed, warehouse, etc.
 
 - funeral chambers
 
 - sewers and their various entries
 
 - police building
 
 - law courts
 
 - jailhouse
 
 - scaffold, for execution sentences
 
 - hospital
 
 - public dispensary, community clinic
 
 - impluvium and reservoir 
 
 - wells
 
Towns are also a place of choice for *safe* social interactions, as combats are expected to be banned there.
