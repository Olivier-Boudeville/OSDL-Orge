Damage Resistance
.................


The damage resistance corresponds to the ability of a creature to withstand certain types of damages. See also: the `Damages`_ section.

This models the fact that some weapons are especially efficient in specific contexts, like a blessed falchion against undeads, a fire blade agains mummies, the enchanched dague of a royal assassin to back-stab, etc.

Reciprocally, specific targets better withstand some kinds of damages than others, due to their nature (ex: having a thick skin) or thanks their current state (ex: protected by magic, wearing an armor, etc.).

.. Note:
  This section deals only with *damage resistance*, i.e. when the creature is known to be hit (generally by an attack): it is unrelated to the ability of that creature to avoid that attack (ex: dodge a blow, resist a spell, etc.).



Species Resistance Modifiers
____________________________


Generally, species with a thick skin, like the Dwarves and the Orcs, tend to better resist to physical damage.

Species renowned for their arcane talent may develop increased resistance against arcane damage or, conversely, might suffer more from them, because of their tight relationships with arcane powers.

See the Damages_ section for a description of all damage types.
