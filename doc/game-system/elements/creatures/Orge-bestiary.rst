Bestiary
========

The bestiary depends heavily on the scenario setting. It is mainly composed of `monsters <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster>`_, in the traditional sense. A complete list can be found in `this <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_species_in_fantasy_fiction>`_ Wikipedia article.


Orge comes with the following built-in species [#]_, listed alphabetically in each theme:

.. [#] The SW can of course add any other creatures of his own. 


Note that not all creatures - notably not all monsters - are a priori hostile to players. Their behaviour is determined by their nature (ex: killing bees may be very agressive) and by their experience (ex: one can attack a specific kind of creatures that happened to hurt him when he was young).
