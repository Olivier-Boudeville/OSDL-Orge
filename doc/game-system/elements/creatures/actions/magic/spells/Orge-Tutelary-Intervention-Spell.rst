Tutelary Intervention Spell
...........................


Suggested In-Game Names
_______________________

This spell could be named:

 - ``Tutelary Intervention`` (english) / ``Intervention tutélaire`` (french)



Spell Effects 
_____________

The caster put his life at stake regarding a specific deity: either the deity answers to this call and bring some help with an action of its choice (according to its goodwill towards the caster), or the deity remains silent and the caster dies immediately, but with no suffering.

If ever the spell succeeds, the deity goodwill will be most probably depleted for long.

Obviously, a last-resort spell: to the best of popular knowledge, deities seldom answer to these calls.

Some deities have been reported to answer these calls quite frequently, always by casting a great flash of lightning against the caller, as if his silent death would not have been enough.

One should not expect that the deity intervention to be a gift of a powerful object or a killing of a dreadful monster. Generally it takes the form of a short dialog between the caster and his deity, the latter giving some advice to the former.

It is said - but unverified - that some deity-specific artefacts could help a believer guessing whether this spell is likely to have a positive outcome for him.

Moreover some places, like well-chosen temples, are more appropriate than others to use this spell. Conversely, ill-chosen temples are for sure among the worst places for that.

Available only in the Cleric path, through rune spellcasting.
