Fugitive Creation Spell
.......................


Suggested In-Game Names
_______________________

This spell could be named:

 - fantasy setting: ``Fugitive Creation`` (english) / ``Création Fugitive`` (french)
 
  

Spell Effects 
_____________

Creates a random small object, usually not very useful but looking a bit precious (trinkets), which will disappear after some time.

Apparently the nature of the object is taken directly from the memory of the caster, explaining why actual creations widely depends on the species and on the caster, who will often make similar objects appear.

Sometimes indelicate vendors succeed in selling these fugitive objects, in the hope imprudent buyers will not bother or fail to retaliate.

Available only in the Mage path, through gesture spellcasting.
