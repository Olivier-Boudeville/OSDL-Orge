Arcane Missile Spell
....................


Suggested In-Game Names
_______________________


This spell could be named:

 - fantasy setting: ``Arcane Missile`` (english) / ``Frappe des Arcanes`` (french)



Spell Effects 
_____________

Throws a missile purely made of arcane material. The missile is small, fast and relatively discreet, but would deal tremendous (arcane) damages on most creatures, especially on the ones that are the closest to the arcane realm.

This spell is difficult to master and expensive to cast, but often quite dreadful.

Only available in the Mage path, through an incantation.
