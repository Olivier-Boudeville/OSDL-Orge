 - fantasy setting: ``Transport Of Recollection`` or ``Teleportation`` (english) / ``Transport des Souvenirs`` or ``Téléportation`` (french)



Spell Effects 
_____________

Allows the caster to teleport to a place he marked previously, which is preferably in sight, otherwise a malus is incurred.

Only the caster can be teleported, and only its body will travel: carried objects, clothes, etc. will stay at the starting location.

This operation is always risky: if the target location is not free (ex: there is an object or a creature at the other end), the teleportation usually fails badly, hurting or killing the teleported creature. 

Some organizations thus built teleportation chambers, designed to offer safe places that can easily be remembered. However the issue was only partially solved, as these places usually experienced quite a lot of traffic, which increases the risk of collisions of teleported wizards in the chamber.

The spell will fail if the location is too far. 

There is always a slight chance of being teleported to another previously marked location, if any.

Available only in the Mage path, through incantation or rune spellcasting.
