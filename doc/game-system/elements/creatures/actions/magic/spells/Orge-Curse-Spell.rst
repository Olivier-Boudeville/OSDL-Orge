Curse Spell
...........


Suggested In-Game Names
_______________________


This spell could be named:

 - fantasy setting: ``Curse`` or ``Decay Mark`` (english) / ``Malédiction`` or ``Sceau de déchéance`` (french)


Spell Effects 
_____________

The target - creature or object - will be cursed and, as such, will turn wrong under various circumstances.

A cursed creature will be weaker, slower to recover, and more prone to fail in most actions, whereas a cursed item will affect any creature in tight relation with it (ex: if wearing a cursed ring, a creature will incur various penalties) in a similar way, making the creature more dull and brittle. 

Available only in the Cleric path, through incantation, gesture, rune or pure mental spellcasting.
