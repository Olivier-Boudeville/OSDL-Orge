Spell Effects 
_____________

When this spell succeeds, the main deity the caster believes in triggers a salvo of strikes in a significant area around the target point.

The closest description for this spell is an arcane shelling.

Note that strikes will affect buildings, objects and creatures, friends and foes alike, and that their precision is poor.

The spell is long to cast, and once successfully cast a kind of ethereal crystal appears at the target point; some duration must be waited until the first strikes occur, provided that the caster is still alive.

All arcane-aware sentient beings will flee such ethereal crystals as soon as they see it. 

If the crystal appears but no escape is possible (ex: being trapped in a town or in a besieged stronghold), then the most frantic wizard hunt will happen, to kill him soon enough.

Available only in the Cleric path, through gesture spellcasting.
