Aquatic Steps Spell
...................


Suggested In-Game Names
_______________________

This spell could be named:

 - fantasy setting: ``Aquatic Steps`` (english) / ``Marche Aquatique`` (french)



Spell Effects 
_____________

If some area of water is still enough (i.e. with little to no waves, like in the case of a slow river, or a calm sea with no wind), then the target creature (usually a Gnome or an Elf, never a pachyderm) can walk slowly on it, for a given duration, and if not too heavy (usually no equipment is carried when trying to perform this operation).

Available in the Mage path, either through incantations or gesture.

Said to work also through rune carving in the Cleric path, but would apply to objects instead of creatures, so that they can better float.
