_____________

This spells allows to gather some information about the presence of undead.

Can operate on objects (ex: to have a chance of knowing whether opening a coffin will result in an undead creature jumping to your throat), creatures (when unsure about the sanity of a creature) and places (so that one can flee from undead nests).

Available only in the Cleric path, through incantation or rune spellcasting.

In the case of rune spellcasting, often clerics enchant their main weapons so that it glows faintly each time undead is approaching.
