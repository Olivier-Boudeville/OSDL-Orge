Call Of Myocastor Coypus Spell
..............................


Suggested In-Game Names
_______________________

This spell could be named:

 - fantasy setting: ``Call Of Myocastor Coypus`` (english) / ``Convocation de Myocastor Coypus`` (french)



Spell Effects 
_____________

Summonings of one or more rats (actually coypu), which are not controlled once they came to existence.

This spell is not a powerful one, but it is relatively easy to succeed. Coypu are not directly dangerous as such, but, if too many break free, they might be found quite harmful.  

Might be useful to generate some mess and distract somebody's attention.

Available in the Mage path, through gesture spellcasting, in the Cleric path, through incantation spellcasting, and in the Bard path, through bardic verse spellcasting. The bardic version allows to summon coypu at a regular pace, as long as the recitation goes on.
