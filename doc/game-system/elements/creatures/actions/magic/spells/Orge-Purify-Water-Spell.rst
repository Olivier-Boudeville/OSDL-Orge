..................


Suggested In-Game Names
_______________________

 - fantasy setting: ``Purify Water`` (english) / ``Purification de l'eau`` (french)



Spell Effects 
_____________

This spell does its best to purify the target water from any harmful element in it (ex: if contaminated or poisoned). Once this spell has operated, cursed water should still be cursed though.

The caster has no way of knowing the water is really drinkable afterwards.

This spell is also useful in some ceremonies and rituals, although it does not produce blessed water.

Available only in the Cleric path, through incantation, gesture, rune or pure mental spellcasting.
