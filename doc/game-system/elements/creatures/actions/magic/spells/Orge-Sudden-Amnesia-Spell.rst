Sudden Amnesia Spell
....................


Suggested In-Game Names
_______________________


This spell could be named:

 - fantasy setting: ``Sudden Amnesia`` (english) / ``Amnésie soudaine`` (french)


Spell Effects 
_____________

Makes a creature forget temporarily some of its formalized knowledge or advanced skills.

Characters may fail to perform such actions like playing an instrument, operating machines or speaking in a foreign language.

Fearsome against arcane users, who might be unable to cast some spells - if not all - afterwards.

The spell was nicknamed the Mage killer, until too many abuses of it made wizards develop efficient countermeasures, including resistance training.

Available only in the Cleric path, through incantation, gesture, rune or pure mental spellcasting.
