Disintegration By Denial Spell
..............................


Suggested In-Game Names
_______________________


This spell could be named:

 - ``Disintegration By Denial`` (english) / ``Désintégration par le Déni`` (french)


Spell Effects 
_____________

The caster attempts to deny the existence of an object or, more frequently, a creature. 

If ever the spell succeeds (which is quite unusual), the target does not even exist anymore.

Rare cases of awful failures have been reported, despite the scarce number of witnesses still alive after such failures.

Cyprus the Grey notably told that, when his mentor Altaber failed to cast his Disintegration By Denial, the operation opened instead a kind of portal to the Arcanes from which a tide of arcane creatures of all sorts bolted and attacked every living creature.

Only Cyprus managed to escape, probably by chance. Contrary to his sayings, most people deems that the portal closed by itself after a while, instead of having been locked by Cyprus.

Available only in the Mage path, through incantation or gesture spellcasting.
