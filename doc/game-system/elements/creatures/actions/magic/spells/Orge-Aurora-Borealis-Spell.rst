Suggested In-Game Names
_______________________


This spell could be named:

 - fantasy setting: ``Aurora Borealis`` or ``Northern Lights`` (english) / ``Aurore Boréale`` (french)



Spell Effects 
_____________

This spell creates weird pale lights, often green, forming often curtains or arcs that spread from the caster as high as they can: when cast outdoor, the lights can be seen kilometers around. Observers can deduce the general direction of the caster, but not pin-point him, due to their vast indistinct shape. 

This greenish or faint red glow sheds some ghostly light, which is especially welcome when stuck in the darkness.

Available only in the Mage path (one of the very few ways of generating lights in that path), through incantation, gesture, rune or pure mental spellcasting.
