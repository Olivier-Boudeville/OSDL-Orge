Spellcasting
------------



General Principles of Spell Casting
...................................

To cast a spell, a bridge must be established between the Arcanes and the physical world, so that some transformations are triggered in the Arcane realm and alter back the physical world.

Correct transformations have the expected consequences in the physical world.

Usually, incorrect transformations are absurd, and do not lead to anything, apart exhausting the caster. Almost correct spells (including interrupted ones) and spells obtained from transformations of correct spells are the most dangerous, as they often yield unexpected if not unwanted outcomes.

For example, some spells are known to be *reversible*, i.e. having opposite effects once either preceded by a reversing arcane prefix or having their symbols reversed.

Long-living arcane users are the ones that learned soon enough that they should better stick to the classical old-fashioned spells, and never stay in the same room as arcane researchers.



Spell Casting Methods
.....................

There are five main methods to cast a spell:

 - Incantations
 - Gesture SpellCasting
 - Rune Carving
 - Bardic Verse
 - Pure Mental SpellCasting

Usually a given spell can only by cast with a few of these methods, if not only one of them.

Notably the ``Rune Carving`` and ``Bardic Verse`` spellcasting methods each support only a relatively small set of very specific spells, and these spells in general could not be cast thanks to any other approach.

Therefore most wizards, once having selected the arcane path(s) they want to follow, not only invest on skills directly relative to that path (ex: if having selected the Mage Path, they might increase their ``Magery`` skills), but also on ``Arcane Technics`` skills, i.e. on skills dedicated to a spell casting method that corresponds to the path and spells they want to favor.

For example, if wanting to be able to cast high-end fireballs (available only in the Mage path), then a wizard should increase its skills in spell casting methods that can apply to fireballs, like Incantations, rather than, say, Bardic Verse.

Finally, some wizards are said to use multiple spellcasting methods simulaneously (usually: incantations and gesture) to further enhance the probability of a successful casting.


Incantations Spellcasting
_________________________

Generally, spells are cast thanks to an incantation, which consists on the strong and clear declamation of the verbal transcription of the series of arcane symbols corresponding to that spell. However arcane powers are based on mental operations, and uttering is only one way among others of casting a spell.

Incantation is the approach favored notably by Humans, Elves and some Goblinoid arcane users. Its advantages are obvious:

 - this is one of the simplest and most effective ways of creating a link with the arcanes

 - spells loudly uttered by impressive mages tend to benefit from a certain psychological impact on opponents. Some wizards made even most of their reputation thanks to their arcane shows

 - although casters are not able to defend themselves during an incantation (even less to attack anybody physically), they can however (with some arcane penalty) still hold objects in their hands; thus once the incantation is over, they can be immediately able to act with the held objects, without incurring the time penalty corresponding to, say, the drawing of their weapons


The main drawbacks of incantations are well-known:

 - they can be hardly silent, so in general all the neighbourhood is aware of the ongoing process, and often tries to stop it by any (violent) means

 - they tend to last for a while (up to a few seconds), increasing the probability of interruptions

 - they depend heavily on the uttering capacity of the caster. Coughing, sneezing, or being drunk are prohibited, and any apprentice whose `Stuttering`_ or, worst, `Dyslexia`_ tendencies are detected is immediately expelled, for obvious security reasons


If the caster is not time-constrained, meditations and rituals can ease his incantations. Rituals are the only way of casting some spells.

The Mage Path and the Cleric Path rely a lot on Incantations, although their incantations differ widely.

Often clerics hold liturgic symbols like crosses or ankhs to reinforce their power, although of course they have to use one free hand for that.

Some clerics tried to use reinforced pointed two-hand crosses for hand-to-hand combat, but they died soon.



Gesture Spellcasting
____________________

With this approach, the arcane user recreates the spell from a series of gestures, executed with its two hands or, rarely, with only one hand.

Compared to incantations, there are real advantages in doing so:

 - it makes stealth spellcasting more possible

 - spellcasting itself tends to be quicker and, according to some sources, more reliable (an ongoing controversy is reported on that point)

However this comes at the cost of:

 - technical difficulty: this form of magic is certainly harder than incantations for most species

 - hands must remain free, which prohibits the caster to hold weapons or shields; then this caster is especially vulnerable on the battlefield

The Mage Path and the Cleric Path are the main ones to rely on Gesture Spellcasting.

Gesture Spellcasting is the natural way of using arcane powers for Gnomes. Other species are seldom comfortable with this approach, except some Humans (often, Mages), who sometimes make use of staffs to improve the upstroke of their gesture.

As for clerics, they use gestures to perform deity-related signs, for example when they make the sign of the Cross.




Rune Carving
____________

Whereas Incantations and Gesture Spellcasting can be performed in real-time (ex: during fights), Rune Carving is a longer yet quite reliable operation that must be prepared: the series of arcane symbols must be carefully engraved or printed on a material (ex: horn, skin, metal, etc.). On completion, spells are triggered. These are usually long-lasting spells, i.e. enchantments.

Due to its nature, this arcane link is mostly used to enchant objects, including jewels (pendants, necklaces, rings, crowns, etc.), armors and weapons.

Dwarf Rune Carving is renowned, as the effects of their work are powerful and long-lasting, but it has been discovered that Goblins and some categories of Orcs had some practise of it too. It is said that unlike dwarves, they make sometimes use of living elements in their carving process, including blood of the caster and sacrified beings, to enhance the spell or alter its effects.

Some strange tattoos and ritual scarifications have been noticed on some corpses of underground sentient creatures, without proof they had an effect on the creature underneath.

The Cleric Path, and, to a lesser extent, the Mage Path, rely a lot on Rune Carving. Clerics often bless or curse items.



Bardic Verse
____________

Because poetry and ballads do not deal blows, this spellcasting method is unfairly despised by many.

However a well-interpreted bardic verse, either only sung, or accompanied with
an instrument, can have tremendous yet different effects on allies and opponents as well: for example, whereas the formers will have their willpower reinforced and their mental fatigue alleviated, conversely opponents may be prone to desillusion, fear and desertion.

Indeed most spells cast through bardic verse will have for implicit target the members of the caster's party that are in hearing range (group spells), as the recitation will be aimed directly to them, talking only to their spirit and to their heart.

Another effect of bardic verse spellcasting is that all beings in the area (i.e. opponents, allies, neutral beings and the caster himself) may suffer from Sonic damages.

This form of arcane operation is still considered weak, but if its effects have less direct impact during battle, they can affect numerous opponents *while letting the caster making use of weapons* (with some penalties, though).

Between fights, verses can soothe physical and psychological wounds, help allies resting or opponents being put on sleep.

The Bard Path is of course the main path to rely on bardic verse spellcasting, although clerics can from time to time sing moving ballads to celebrate their deities.



Pure Mental SpellCasting
________________________

Some elite spellcasters are said to be able to perform Pure Mental SpellCasting, i.e. spellcasting only thanks to a mental process, involving no special movement (but huge penalties). This is a very unusual form of magic.

Very little information about these casters is known, quite presumably because the creatures able to do so must be very few, and because this technics results in an almost total discretion.

It is said that Pure Mental Casters are either Gnomes or Elves. Public knowledge is unsure about Humans.

They are supposed to serve only the Mage Path, but suspect miracles seem to have occurred after clerics, according to their sayings, had made intense silent prayers.



Spellcasting In Practice
........................

The caster must first select a spell and, if appropriate, a target. Then he should check that all the prerequisites are met so that his spell has a chance to succeed.


Having Enough Mana
__________________

First spell consumable is the caster's mana.

If the spell demands more mana than the caster's maximal mana capacity, no successful casting can be hoped for.

If the caster had enough mana capacity, but does not have enough mana points currently, he must replenish his stocks.

Lost mana points can be regained:

 - at a low pace, when enough time has elapsed, with significant bonuses obtained when resting (including sleeping) or, still more, when meditating (for Mages), praying (for Clerics) or improvising (for Bards)

 - in special places filled with magic (ex: some temples)

 - with specific elixirs or spells targeted by other magical users (ex: mana drains)


Casting The Spell
_________________

When all the prerequisites are met, the casting can be performed, with one of the spellcasting approaches. It may fail or succeed, on the emitter side, depending notably of the capacities of its caster. Most targeted spells require the caster to be on eye contact with their target.

Once successfully cast, a spell may fail or succeed, depending on the context. In all cases the mana is spent.

Some spells can be combined between multiple casters, so that their effect is stronger.

Finally, some spells can be *chained*: an ice bolt can branch into more bolts, fireballs may bounce and split, buffs (enchantments for temporary creature enhancement) may be triggered in sequences.


Spell Successfully Cast
***********************

Once a spell has been successfully cast, impacted creatures might be able to react (see `Reactions`_), i.e. to try to escape from its effects, if wanted.

For example, a creature may want to try to dodge a Fireball, escape from an Icy Rain spell, but few try to avoid a Protecting Aura.

If the reaction of the target succeeds, it will not be affected by the spell.

Otherwise the spell effects will be applied to it, and then damage resistance(s) will step in (see `Damage Resistance`_).

Depending on the spell, the target will have either to resist to the spell itself (ex: resistance against a Projected Confusion) and in that case Arcane resistance will matter, or to resist to the *effects* of that spell, using the appropriate damage resistance (ex: *Sonic Resistance* against a *Sonic Blast*).


Spell Failure
*************

Having enough mana, having the right reagents and knowing how the spell should be cast is not sufficient, as the wizard must also have enough magical skills so that the spell can succeed. But even if all these prerequisites are satisfied, a limited risk of failure still exists.

Should a spell fail, on most cases nothing special will happen, spell will just fizzle, and its prerequisites (mana, reagents, etc.) will be lost.

On other cases, the spell may backfire, and deal damages, especially to the caster. This is specially true for *Battle Arcane* spells, as the high energy gathered for them has to be cleared one way or another.

On rare cases, with some spells the failure might result in various other spell-specific unwanted effects, immediately apparent or not. Silent spell failure is one of the worst pitfalls threatening the unwary arcane user.



How to improve Spellcasting
...........................

Experienced spellcasters discovered that practise allowed them to cast more spells, or more powerful ones, or both.

This corresponds to various arcane skills, improving the progress in:

 - an arcane path: Mage Path, Cleric Path, or Bard Path

 - a spellcasting method: `Incantations Spellcasting`_, `Gesture Spellcasting`_, `Rune Carving`_, `Bardic Verse`_, `Pure Mental SpellCasting`_

 - arcane development: `Mana Tank`_, `Chained Casts`_
