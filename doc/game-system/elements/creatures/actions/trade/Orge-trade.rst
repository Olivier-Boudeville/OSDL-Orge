Exchanging Goods
================

Transactions.


Bartering
---------

Purchasing
----------

As in real life, no special interface is proposed to exchange goods or trade for money, no transaction system is provided on purpose: characters (hence players) will have to negociate on their own, and are exposed to all failures taht can be imagined in the business process.

Thus one has to ensure the other part is somewhat honest, for example depending on its reputation (for what it is worth), and/or by requesting the services of a third party, and/or by ensuring any fraud would be heavily punished by superior forces.


Stealing
--------

All merchants can be stolen. This is not easy though, as they often take various measures against thieves, and it is quite risky, from being thrown in jail by the guards to being simply slaughtered by the bodyguard of an angry merchant.


Money & Currency
----------------

In Orge, all the monetary values are internally manipulated as a unique unit, the *credit* (abbreviation: ``C``). Depending on the setting, a credit can be mapped to dollars, gold coins, martian credit, etc.

As Orge focuses primarily on fantasy settings, here is the default mapping:

   ================ ===================== ========================= ================  
   Name of currency Currency Abbreviation Value In Smaller Currency Value in Credits  
   ================ ===================== ========================= ================  
   Copper Coin      cc                    N/A						1				  
   Silver Coin      sc                    1 sc = 20 cc  			20  			  
   Gold Coin [#]_   gc                    1 gc = 50 sc 				1000 			  
   ================ ===================== ========================= ================  

.. [#] Gold, compared to copper and even silver, is quite rare in Orge. 

.. Hint:: Usually making the change is a gameplay killer (since it is too cumbersome and fundamentally uninteresting), thus Orge sees it as a technical detail that can be abstracted away, and no monetary exchange will raise change issues.
