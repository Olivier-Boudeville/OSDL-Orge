A huge part of player immersion can come from the in-game audio environment. 

With Orge it is composed classically of:

 - a set of background musics, chosen to match the ambiance of a location or quest events
 
 - special effects, to "enhance the player experience", as marketing people say 
 
 
We believe these special effects are essential, and should play at multiple levels. 

The first level consists on sounds that directly illustrate the action. This includes all special effects like footsteps, door openings, weapon colliding,  grunts of monsters lurking out of sight, heart beating, etc.

A second level corresponds to sounds that generate indistinct threat and  dramatic tension, like an ominous chord progression, or that suggest the ennemy is moving forward, plotting against the player and gathering its forces.

The game should be hardly playable with muted sound.


At game startup, the player should be offered to tune appropriately its audio volume thanks to a sound sample that should be played-back in an intermediate volume.
