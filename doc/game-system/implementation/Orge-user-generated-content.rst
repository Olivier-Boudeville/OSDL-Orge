User-Generated Content
======================

Playing in one's virtual world is pleasing, but being able to add some elements of its own is often considered still more enjoyable.

For the ruler of a virtual world, user-generated content is probably the most interesting way of expanding the game and renewing it. Thus this should be encouraged, beginning from the release to the public of some of the tools, editors, documentation, resources (if the license allows it) that were gathered for in-house world creation.
