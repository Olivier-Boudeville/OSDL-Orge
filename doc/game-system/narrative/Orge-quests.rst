Quests
======

Dramatic tension can be increased by quests whose success is dictated by achievements within strict time limits.

They are rewarded by:

 - plot progress (milestone unlocked)
 - gain of experience points
 - wealth gain, monetary (gold) and/or not (jewels, etc.)
 - special objects (ex: magical ones)
 - help (ex: powerful NPC joining the main character)
 - special scenes and musics

Basic quest examples:

 - free a character and escort him back to a given point before given time-based event	
 - capture a given boss, too well-guarded for the brute-force raid (infiltration needed)
 - infiltrate given secret society
