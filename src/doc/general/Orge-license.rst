Orge License
============

This document describes the Orge game system. This game system is composed of a model (ruleset), and an implementation of it.


The Orge game system as a whole (i.e. the model and the implementation) is released under a `Creative Commons <http://creativecommons.org>`_ license whose name is *Attribution Noncommercial Share Alike 3.0*, also known as *by-nc-sa*.

The initial plan was to release specifically the Orge implementation under the `GNU General Public License <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>`_ (GPL). However the GPL focuses only on software being released, thus it would have allowed a third-party to run commercially Orge, on server-side (hence with no software to release), which was not wanted.

.. comment::  GNU AGPLv3 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License) might be used, but I was unable to find a clear analysis. What I understood led me to think it is too permissive for my needs.
