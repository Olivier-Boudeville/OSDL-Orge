Death

Place of Death
--------------

Most RPG insist on character building and provide some ways of bypassing the total loss of one's character, as it would be deemed to frustrating for a player to have to start from scratch again.

On non-persistent RPG, saving the game regularly (with ou without restriction) is a technical solution. On persistent RPG, time cannot be changed at will and often various solutions are implemented directly in the gameplay, like resurrection in temples, afterlife in the wild, etc.

One considerable drawback of non-terminal death is that it allows players to act without much fear for the consequences: for example there is no point in an assassination attempt on a king if, even in case of success, he will able to be back within minutes, as if nothing had happened.

On the contrary, if permanent death (a.k.a. `permadeath <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permadeath>`_) was retained, then that king would most probably be a lot more careful when travelling, would have to select carefully his escort (powerful and loyal guards), there could be plots among his vassals, etc. This kind of power struggle would benefit a lot to gameplay, and would require the player a lot more of self-control and constant care for his character, lest it is removed permanently from the game .

Thus in Orge we favour permadeath. Note that it tends to make a character's health binary, being either in perfect condition or dead, as the role of permanent injuries is considerably lessen thanks to magic. A related concern for players is that "perfect condition" is to be understood regarding a given age.


As stated in `Place of Death`_, in Orge, once you're dead, you're dead.


 


Loot & Possessions
------------------
 
Another kind of reward can be the loot given by a defeated creature, either directly (ex: after being itself searched or after a tribute is given for surrender), or indirectly (ex: treasure in a chest, in the creature dwelling). 

By default in Orge (i.e. unless the scenario specifically changes that behaviour), a searched creature will show exactly its expected belongings [#]_, instead of having the SW or GM specify explicitly what the creature is to drop.


.. [#] It sounds obvious, but in many games when one finally succeeds in killing a powerful knight, no weapon can be retrieved, which is totally unrealistic. Conversely, it would be quite awkward to find gold coins on wild animals.


Respawn
-------

Most of the creatures in Orge are expected to be specifically instanciated by the SW. When they die there is no reason they should be replaced.

However in some cases it might be convenient to define `respawn points` or `respawn areas`, i.e. locations where a certain density of certain creatures has to exist. This is especially true for MMORPG, where players might intentionally exhaust an area whereas this is only an artefact of the simulation. For example, in the edge of a huge and deep forest, a respawn area could be defined, instead of having to simulate each and every squirrel in that forest. 

These respawn locations should be used with care, since they are often abused by players to level up and/or to block other players from doing so. It is up to the SW to tell whether, for his story, this should be possible.
