Health and Wounds
-----------------


Character Needs For Survival and Well-Being
-------------------------------------------

A character would suffer from the lack of:

 - food
 - water
 - oxygen
 - sleep
 - light

If fun and demanding at first, micro-managing all these resources might become tedious. A way of introducing them initially while in the long term freeing the successful player from their management is to offer more expensive but less cumbersome replacements for them.

This can be done for example by ensuring that the loot of most high-ranked monsters includes rich food (ex: dragon steacks), that advanced dungeons levels have a minimal density of drinkable fountains, and that, instead of torches to be bought, transported and replaced, either sustainable oil lamps or lanterns or relatively cheap spells of light are available.




Health
......

Health determines how much damage can a character withstand before falling inconscious or dying. 
Damages may result from combats, accidents (ex: falling from too high), disease (ex: being poisoned), arcane effects (ex: when wearing a cursed piece of armor). 

Health is only a physical indicator: contrary to fatigue, mental health is not specifically managed in Orge.

The nominal health of a character is determined by:
  
  - its Constitution and, to a less extent, Strength, Willpower Attributes
  - its Species
  - its Gender
  - its Age and Longevity Attribute 
  - a random factor
  
Health can be further modified by:

  - lack of vital resource: food, water, oxygen, sleep, light, blood
  - fatigue
  - arcane effects (ex: Vitality Blessing)
  - damages of all sorts
  - cures and first aid
  
  
Wounds
......

Wounds are currently modelled by the Game System only as losses of life. No organ location nor permanent injury are taken into account for the moment.
