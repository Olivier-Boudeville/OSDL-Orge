Damage Resistance
.................


The damage resistance corresponds to the ability of a creature to withstand certain types of damages. See also: the `Damages`_ section. 


Species Resistance Modifiers
____________________________


Generally, species with a thick skin, like the Dwarves and the Orcs, tend to better resist to physical damage.

Species renowned for their arcane talent may develop increased resistance against arcane damage or, conversely, might suffer more from them, because of their tight relationships with arcane powers.
