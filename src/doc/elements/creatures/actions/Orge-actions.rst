Main Supported Creature Actions
...............................


Communicating
_____________

Most communications are to take place through interactive dialogs, in the IRC-like chat system, with or without predefined sets of questions and answers, so that NPC and characters driven by real players could be seamlessly integrated.

Moreover a "gesture editor" could be included in-game, so that players could define their own gestures. This would allow for non-verbal (silent) communication, for example to be used when cheating in a tavern or to give hand signals to a squad during stealth operations like ambushes.

_________________

Some weapons, like the `Halberd`_, provide bonuses.


Fighting
________

See `A Focus on Conflicts & Combats`_.


Fleeing
_______

A creature having accumulated too much mental fatigue or being overwhelmed by fear will try to flee, i.e. to try to escape from known threats at maximum speed and with little planning. 

The flee can be interrupted if the creature succeeds a `Resisting Fear`_ action. Strong willpower and the Leadership y


Frightening
___________

Some monsters are so disturbing lifeforms for a non-accustomed observer that she may be paralysed or even, in the case of abnormal abominations (Cthulu-like creatures), be scared to madness or to instant death. 


Hiding
______

Hiding consists on trying to escape from the perception fields of other creatures.

The success depends mainly on: 

 - the type of environment and local setting, that can help or hinder hiding
 - the species of the hiding creature(s); some are bigger and stealthier than others
 - their clothes
 - their Camouflage skill
 - the acuteness of the perception of other creatures
 - if they are performing scouting/recon, i.e. trying specifically to search for concealed creatures

Generally hiding will fail for the whole group as soon as one of the other creatures detects one hidden creature. 

An ambush corresponds to a party hiding themselves and waiting for others to come at range. If these creatures are caught by surprise, they will loose their Initiative phase, and thus be unable to act during the first combat round. Moreover they may have to draw and ready their weapons before being able to defend themselves efficiently.



Lighting a fire
_______________

The success of this actions depends a lot on the character having `Kindling Objects`_, or Fire Spells, or the creature having some Breathing Fire ability. Without any of them, little chances would remain. 


Moving
______

All movements will be harder to perform with drawn weapons or too much carried weight.



Rallying
________

A creature can try to rally other ones in combat, so that they stop fleeing or are less likely to do so. Characters will be convinced of joining the party more easily as well. The Leadership_ trait and high Charisma should help a lot here.


Seducing
________

In Orge a creature can attempt to seduce another creature of the same species but, in most cases, of the opposite gender, thanks to non-verbal communication. In case of success, the seduced creature would incur significant penalties if it were to harm the seducing one.


Stealing
________

Some creatures may tend to steal the possessions of other creatures.
There are all-purpose kleptomaniacs (they will try to rob all kinds of objects) and specialized ones (ex: only foods interest them).
