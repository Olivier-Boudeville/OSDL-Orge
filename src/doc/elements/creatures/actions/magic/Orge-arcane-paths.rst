Arcane Paths
------------


The Three Major Paths
.....................

Many paths lead to arcane operations, but three of them are the main ones: the ``Mage`` Path, the ``Cleric`` Path and the ``Bard`` Path.

Although each path uses its own vocabulary, actually all arcane operations are some sorts of spells.


Mage Path
_________

The Mage Path focuses on spell casting, mostly based on Intelligence, marginally on Wisdom and Willpower.

Mages are particularly reknown for their Battle Arcane spells, which include quite a wide range of pure energy and elemental spells, like the famous fireball.

When speaking of invocation and summoning, mages would deserve a better reputation, as they are all but clueless. 



Cleric Path
___________

The Cleric Path focuses on divinity calling, mostly based on Wisdom, marginally on Charisma and Willpower.

Clerics are warrior-priests. They can call on wide range of different gods and saints, each with a unique personality. They can serve only one god, or a pantheon.

The divine powers they may receive come at a cost: service, devotion and loyalty.

They prefer subdueing their foe rather than killing them. If however they happen to have to murder a character, then they can dedicate his death to a deity of their choice - some appreciate it.



Bard Path
_________

The Bard Path focuses on suggestion instilling, unleashing the powers of Music and Word, mostly based on Charisma, marginally on Intelligence and Willpower

Bards are Jack-of-all-trades that emphasize often on social interactions: far from being lone wolves, they often blossom out when having joined a party, as they are complementary of most of the traditional profiles found among adventurers. So is the magic they perform.

A journey with a practioner of the Bard Path will often be lighter, safer, and more enjoyable. Their entertaining skills indeed improve mood, morale and will, in taverns as well as in the wilderness, in times of fighting as well as in times of rest.

As a consequence, the Bard arcane path is almost only obtained from Bardic Verse (sung accompanied with instruments or not) and most of the spells they can cast that way will affect whole groups: notably their party, less frequently any group of opponents.

One nice thing about sung Bardic Verse is that it leaves both hands free, therefore a bard may fight as any non-stealth soldier, at the expense of fatigue and concentration though.




Other Arcane Paths
.................

Besides these three paths, other ones (called *Minor Paths* by the practioners of the ones already mentioned) exist, including - but not limited to - alchemy, augur, omen, presage and divination, shamanism, hex, jinxes, bewitching, thaumaturgics, trance, voodoo, vampirism, and sortilege.




Paths & Skills
..............

When an arcane user tries to cast a spell from a given path, various factors influence the outcome, including the actual skills of that user: experience matters a lot.

There are transverse arcane skills, such as ``Arcane`` (the root of all arcane skills), ``Arcane Technics`` and ``Arcane Development``, which apply regardless of the arcane paths.

But there are also path-specific skills. The topmost ones are:

 - ``Magery``, from which all the skills for the ``Mage`` Path flow
 - ``Priesthood``, from which all the skills for the ``Cleric`` Path flow
 - ``Bardic Verse``, from which all the skills for the ``Bard`` Path flow


Each spell is generally tied to at least one Arcane Path: for example, when wanting to cast a Fireball spell, which is a spell typically in the ``Mage`` path, one should have strong ``Magery`` skills to have a reasonable chance of casting it successfully.

Moreover, in that case, having a Mage profile regarding the caster *statistics* (i.e., here, benefiting from a high Intelligence) helps also a lot to cast such spells.

As these three arcane paths are quite different, a wizard can hardly be good at more than one of them: this would involve having numerous high, yet distinct, characteristics and advanced skills, which usually cannot happen.

Therefore a wizard generally prefers to specialize into one path, at the exclusion of others.
 
Paths other than the three major ones are almost never taught, to the point that in the mainstream arcane community no specific skill has been identified for them yet.
