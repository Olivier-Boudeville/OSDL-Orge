Rune Trap Spell
...............


Suggested In-Game Names
_______________________


This spell could be named:

 - fantasy setting: ``Rune Trap`` (english) / ``Piège Runique`` or ``Runes-pièges`` (french)


Spell Effects 
_____________

The caster affixes a rune over some material (ex: a door, a pavement), and once the rune becomes activated (a few moment after having been affixed), the first living creature (including the caster) that will happen to come close to that rune will trigger its effects, which depend on which runes were selected.

Usually these effects consist on an explosion, the rune bursting into flames around the creature that triggered it. Some runes have been reported to poison or confuse the creatures nearby.

A legend tells that Alpavic the Wise had put such rune traps all along a corridor, so that they would heal and buff him while fleeing from the Paortil Great Hydra from which he intended to steal a powerful jewel. Sadly he never managed to reach the first rune.
