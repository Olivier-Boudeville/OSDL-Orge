Suggested In-Game Names
_______________________

This spell could be named:

 - ``Stone Petrification`` (english) / ``Pétrification lapidaire`` (french)



Spell Effects 
_____________

If the spell succeeds, the target creature is totally paralyzed for a given duration during which no damage can be inflicted to the creature.

The creature is then surrounded by a brown glazing, looking a bit as if it was made of stone.

The twofold effect has been found useful under various circumstances: this spell might be more versatile than expected.

Available only in the Mage path, through incantation spellcasting.
