Spell Effects 
_____________

Deals some arcane damages to a target.

This spell is not able to inflict tremendous damages, but most wizards, except the greatest ones, are quite fond of it: fast to cast and to strike, reliable, cost-effective, it has many advantages.

The most powerful wizards use them sometimes to draw the attention of their peers, as if casting it did not involve any effort for them.

Available only in the Mage path, through incantation, gesture, or pure mental spellcasting.
