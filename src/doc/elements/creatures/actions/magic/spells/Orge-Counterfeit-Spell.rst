Spell Effects 
_____________

Creates a duplicate of the target which will be a pure illusion, almost visually perfect, although casting no shadow.

The illusion will not affect the other senses (ex: will not produce sounds, cannot be touched, etc.).

The duplicate will appear at a random place close to the caster, and then perform all the movements of the target, as long as the spell lasts.

Available only in the Cleric path, through incantation or gesture.
