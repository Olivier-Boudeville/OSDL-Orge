Little Thumb Spell
..................


Suggested In-Game Names
_______________________

This spell could be named:

 - ``Little Thumb`` (english) / ``Petit Poucet`` (french)



Spell Effects 
_____________

As long as the spell lasts, the target will drop small arcane peebles (one every ten seconds). Each one will disappear around one hour after it has been dropped.   
It is a convenient way of marking one's route, although some creatures tend to move, collect or eat them [#]_.	 


.. [#] Inspired from the literary fairy tale of Charles Perrault, *Le Petit Poucet*.

Note that any elemental eating this kind of arcane reification will be considerably strengthen.
