Spell Effects 
_____________

This is an all-purpose advanced ethereal shield, long-lasting and quite cost effective.

Most high-ranking clerics are always surrounded by such aura, although the usage is to remove them in formal social events and meetings, to underline the fact that the other participants are trusted.

Available only in the Cleric path, for all spellcasting approaches, i.e. through incantation, gesture, rune, bardic verse or pure mental spellcasting.
