Divine Incarnation Spell
........................


Suggested In-Game Names
_______________________


This spell could be named:

 - fantasy setting: ``Divine Incarnation`` (english) / ``Incarnation divine`` (french)



Spell Effects 
_____________

The caster implores the main deity he believes in to incarnate itself in him, to embody temporarily and act instead of him, on his behalf.

If the spell succeeds, the reification of a full-blown deity is often devastating.

Last resort spell, which almost always fail.

If the spell fails, nothing happens and any new attempt will be still more likely to fail.

Following factors led to an increased probability of success for this spell:

 - the deity considers its apparition to be valuable (quite rare)
 - the deity holds the caster in high esteem (rare)
 - another deity just incarnated in the neighborhood  

The last factor explains why, despite deities almost never incarnate, more often than expected multiple deities can been seen when it happens.

When this happens, usually a side managed to make its deity appear, and then the balance is somewhat restored when the other side succeeds in doing the same. This is a way of sorting out quarrels between deities.

Once they finally get back to the Arcanes, calmed down, usually there is no living creature left behind; there is no reward for believers.

Available only in the Cleric path, through incantation spellcasting.
