Spell Effects 
_____________

In the area effect of this spell, creatures of all sides will have trouble performing heavy fighting: they will be soon fatigued, feeling as if needing some rest, strikes will be less violent, and real hate will be harder to sustain. Efforts will be deemed almost fruitless anyway.

Arcane creatures will not be affected at all by this spell.

Available only in the Bard path, through bardic verse spellcasting.
