Spell Effects 
_____________

This spell impacts negatively a creature, regarding either its fatigue, health or magical capacity, over time, i.e. regularly during a given period of time, and a part of what is stolen from the target is given back to the caster and, presumably, another part is given to any deity the caster is associated with. 

Neither the caster, the deity nor the target controls which of the three resources will be affected.

Available only in the Cleric path, through incantation or rune spellcasting.
