Call Of Myocastor Coypus Spell
..............................


Suggested In-Game Names
_______________________

This spell could be named:

 - ``Call Of Myocastor Coypus`` (english) / ``Convocation de Myocastor Coypus`` (french)



Spell Effects 
_____________

Summonings of one or more rats (actually coypu), which are not controlled once they came to existence.

This spell is not a powerful one, but it is relatively easy to succeed. Coypu are not directly dangerous as such, but if too many break free they might be found quite harmful.  

Might be useful to generate some mess and distract somebody's attention.
