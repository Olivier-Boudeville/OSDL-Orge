Suggested In-Game Names
_______________________

This spell could be named:

 - ``Tutelary Intervention`` (english) / ``Intervention tutélaire`` (french)



Spell Effects 
_____________

The caster put his life at stake regarding a specific deity: either the deity answers to this call and acts (according to its goodwill towards the caster), or the deity remains silent and the caster dies immediately.

Obviously, a last-resort spell: to the best of popular knowledge, deities seldom answer to these calls.
