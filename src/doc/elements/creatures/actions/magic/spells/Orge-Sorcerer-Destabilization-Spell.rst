Suggested In-Game Names
_______________________

This spell could be named:

 - ``Sorcerer Destabilization`` (english) / ``Déstabilisation du Sorcier`` (french)



Spell Effects 
_____________

If the spell succeeds, the target will have trouble to perform magic during a small duration.

The most destabilized wizards are the ones using incantations, as these lyrics mix up with the spells they intend to cast. 

Due to the induced confusion, there is a slight risk that they cast an unexpected spell, for better or for worse.

Available only in the Bard path, through bardic verse spellcasting.
