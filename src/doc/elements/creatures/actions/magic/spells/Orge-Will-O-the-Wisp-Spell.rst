Spell Effects 
_____________

Generates ghostly lights which look like an often blueish flickering lamp, and are sometimes said to recede if approached.

This soft and illusive light has no determinable source, does not produce smoke nor ignite objects. 

A lot of creatures are puzzled by these lights. This spell has often been used to divert and lure undead creatures.

Available only in the Bard path, through bardic verse spellcasting.

The corresponding bardic verse is sad and touching.
