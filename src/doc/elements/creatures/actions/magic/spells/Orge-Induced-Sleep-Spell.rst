Spell Effects 
_____________

All creatures - friend or foe - at hearing range will endure a tropism towards sleep: faintly aware of the music, they may doze off.

Unless the caster took special measures, it will be affected by the spell as well, and may in turn fall asleep.

Useful to eliminate poorly trained guards on the watch, especially at night.

Available only in the Bard path, through bardic verse spellcasting.
