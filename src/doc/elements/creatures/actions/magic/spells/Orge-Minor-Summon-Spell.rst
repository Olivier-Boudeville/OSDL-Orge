Spell Effects 
_____________

Summons a very minor and basic arcane creature, which will obey almost blindly (in theory) the caster in the strict limits of its quite low intelligence.

Although they sincerely dread the caster, they seem to often experience some indolence, if not some kind of discreet laziness.

Often cast at will by major summoners for mundane tasks: stirring a potion, being on the watch, carrying messages, being falsely accused and treated as whipping-boys, etc.

Such summoners are often followed by several of them, for conveniency and, they believe, style. They call them their *mushes*, which by extension became an insult.

A mush costs almost nothing for them, but, as an unexpected revenge, performs hardly more.

See also: `Major Summon Spell`_, `Call Of Myocastor Coypus Spell`_, `Call Of the Beast Spell`_, and `Conjured Servant Spell`_.

Available in the Mage path, through gesture and pure mental spellcasting.
