Spell Effects 
_____________

The target undead creature will flee the caster. Minor undeads will be blasted immediatly, whereas more important ones will feel at least a strong urge to go away, if not some harm.

The spell is sometimes cast on objects linked to the undead world, to remove this link, or even on places, if they are believed to be haunted.

One of the most efficient spells against undead.

Said to have a similar yet attenuated effect on some arcane creatures.

Available only in the Cleric path, through incantation or gesture spellcasting.

A cleric not having cast this spell is undead meat. Once cast, the prey becomes the hunter.
