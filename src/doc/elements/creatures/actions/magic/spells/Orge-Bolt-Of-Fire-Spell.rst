Bolt of Fire Spell
..................


Suggested In-Game Names
_______________________


This spell could be named:

 - fantasy setting: ``Bolt of Fire`` or ``Firebolt`` (english) / ``Eclair de Feu`` or ``Griffe Infernale`` (french)



Spell Effects 
_____________

The spell generates a sudden bolt of fire from the caster, that will make the first solid obstacle being hit catch fire violently.

Significant fire damages will be dealt. Although they are other missile attacks that actually inflict more damage, the bolt of fire is dreaded because most creatures, especially the ones the more vulnerable to heat, will start to panic and will focus on putting out the fire instead of attacking the caster, or even defending themselves. 

Available in the Mage path, through incantation, gesture or pure mental spellcasting.
