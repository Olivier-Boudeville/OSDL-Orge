Acid Missile Spell
..................



Suggested In-Game Names
_______________________


This spell could be named:

 - fantasy setting: ``Acid Missile`` (english) / ``Projection d'acide`` (french)



Spell Effects 
_____________

Throws an acid missile to target point. As soon as this missile hits a solid body, it will project on it a kind of strong liquid acid.

As long as the acid is not removed in some way, it will deal (acid) damage to any creature it happens to flow over.

Acid will eat permeable surfaces (ex: leather armor) and soon will not be removable from its target, whereas waterproof surfaces like a breast plate will provide good acid protection.

Available from the Mage path only, can be cast through incantation or gesture (recommended), or through a pure mental effort (strongly disapproven, but a bit less difficult than expected though).
