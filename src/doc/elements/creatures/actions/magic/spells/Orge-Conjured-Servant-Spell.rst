Spell Effects 
_____________

Notifies the main deity that the caster believes in (if any) that some help would be welcome, in the form of a servant elected by the deity among its worshippers.

The servant is usually an arcane being granted with unknown powers and sometimes with its private agenda, specified by the deity but seldom fully disclosed to the caster.

The creature has a tendency to act as the caster requests, but some of these so-called servants are however filthy wicked traitors.

Available only in the Clerics path, through incantation or rune spellcasting.
