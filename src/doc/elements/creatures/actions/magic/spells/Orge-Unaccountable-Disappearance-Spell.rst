Spell Effects 
_____________

If the spell succeeds, the target has high chances of being invisible to most creatures for a short time.

Probability of being detected depends on the observer, and the target can be spotted thanks to the other senses, notably if it makes some noise.

Chances of vanishing from an observer's point of view while being already in its sight are quite poor.

A lot of actions (notably attacking or casting a spell) are very likely to break the invisibility.

An attenuated form of this spell is the `Chameleon Spell`_.

Available only in the Mage path, through incantation, gesture or rune spellcasting.
