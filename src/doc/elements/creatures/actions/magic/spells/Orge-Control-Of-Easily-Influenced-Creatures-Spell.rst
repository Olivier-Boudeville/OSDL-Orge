Spell Effects 
_____________

Some creatures have a weak will and might be controlled in some way by the caster of such a spell, for a small duration.

The more powerful the caster is, the greatest the influence and duration are, and the more advanced the creature can be.

Trying to make a creature perform an action which is against its nature will most often break the influence (ex: trying to force a monster to commit suicide).

This spell is close to charm and hypnosis.

Available in the Mage path, through gesture spellcasting, in the Cleric path, through incantation spellcasting, and in the Bard path, through bardic verse spellcasting
