Spell Effects 
_____________

Some creatures have a weak will and might be controlled in some way by the caster of such a spell, for a small duration.

The more powerful the caster is, the greatest the influence and duration are, and the more advanced the creature can be.

Trying to make a creature perform an action which is against its nature will most often break the influence (ex: trying to force a monster to commit suicide).

This spell is close to charm and hypnosis.
