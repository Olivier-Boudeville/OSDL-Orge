Projected Confusion Spell
.........................


Suggested In-Game Names
_______________________

This spell could be named:

 - fantasy setting: ``Projected Confusion`` (english) / ``Confusion Projetée`` (french)



Spell Effects 
_____________

All the creatures in the target area - especially advanced sentient beings - that fail to resist the spell are affected by a period of irrationality and a lack of conscious reasoning, which lasts a few moments.

Most of these creatures will end up acting absurdly, colliding with the surrounding creatures and objects, or remaining paralyzed, sometimes drooling.

The caster can be affected as well, if in the area of effect.

Available only in the Bard path, through bardic verse spellcasting.
