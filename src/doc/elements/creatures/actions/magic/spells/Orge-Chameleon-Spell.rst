The target of this spell benefits from an increased ability not to be spotted when hiding. Camouflage and stealth operations like ambushes are then easier.

Each action of the target, including moving, leads to the risk of being noticed.

A far stronger form of this spell is the `Unaccountable Disappearance Spell`_.
