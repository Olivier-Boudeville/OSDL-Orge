Chameleon Spell
...............


Suggested In-Game Names
_______________________

This spell could be named:

 - ``Chameleon`` (english) / ``Caméléon`` (french)



Spell Effects 
_____________

The group targeted by this spell benefits from an increased ability not to be spotted when hiding. Camouflage and stealth operations like ambushes are then easier.

Each action of any member of the group, including moving, leads to the risk of being noticed. In this case the whole group looses its stealth bonus.

Available only in the Bard path, through bardic verse spellcasting.

A far stronger form (yet one-creature-only) of this spell is the `Unaccountable Disappearance Spell`_.
