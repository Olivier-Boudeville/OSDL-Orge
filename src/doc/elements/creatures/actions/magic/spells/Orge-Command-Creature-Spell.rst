Command Creature Spell
......................


Suggested In-Game Names
_______________________

This spell could be named:

 - ``Command Creature`` or ``Strong Mind Control`` (english) / ``Commande des Esprits Majeurs`` (french)



Spell Effects 
_____________

If the spell succeeds, the target creature is to a large extent controlled by the caster, which is its puppet master. 

This is by far the most powerful spell for mind control, and the mental defenses of the victim must have been almost totally disrupt beforehand.

Failing this spell might result in the target becoming very mad against the caster, with a will temporarily inflexible, a bit like a berserker. Almost no obstacle will then slow them down until they have thrashed the caster.

Available only in the Cleric path, through incantation or gesture spellcasting.
