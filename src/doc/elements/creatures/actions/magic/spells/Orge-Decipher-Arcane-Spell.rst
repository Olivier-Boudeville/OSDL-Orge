Spell Effects 
_____________

The caster of this spell is able to better understand what are the links of the target - object or creature - regarding the Arcanes.

Cast on an object, the spell can help identifying its use, whether it is blessed, cursed or linked in any way to the Arcanes, if it used to belong to a wizard, if it was involved in an arcane operation, if, arcane-wise, it is a powerful or useful object, etc.

Cast on a creature, the spell can help detecting any enchantment still operating on it (including blessings and curses), whether the creature comes from the real world or is an Arcane incarnation, whether it is an arcane user itself or whether some influence is weighting on its will, etc. 

Available only in the Mage path, through incantation spellcasting.
