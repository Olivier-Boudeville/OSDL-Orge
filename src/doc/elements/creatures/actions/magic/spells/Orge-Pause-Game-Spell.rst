Spell Effects 
_____________

The spell pauses the game session, so that it can be resumed later.

The game will be frozen as long as the caster maintain his spell and that the spell lasts. Then automatically the game resumes.

The game may decide to introduce creatures that would themselves trigger this spell, so that the player does not play too long (ex: five minutes of pause every two hours of play).

When the spell is cast, a specific sound can be heard. When the spell vanishes, another one can be head, so that the player is notified when a sanity break ended.

This spell is maintained by the will of its caster, so he can stop the pause at will, at any time.

Mostly to be used in a single player context.

Available in all paths, through all spellcasting methods relevant for that path.
