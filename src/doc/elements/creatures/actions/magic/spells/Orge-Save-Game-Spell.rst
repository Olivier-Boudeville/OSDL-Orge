Spell Effects 
_____________

This spell saves the game session, so that it can be restored later.

Little skill is needed to cast this spell, but it still has a significant drawback: its casting is rather long, and awfully noisy and visible.

Hostile creatures at hearing and/or sighting range will probably notice either the very peculiar lights it triggers and/or, still more problematic, the characteristic noises it generates.

As soon as they hear the beginning of this recitative, many hostile advanced creatures know what to do in these circumstances: they rush on the caster, who is often quite vulnerable during the spell casting, and try to interrupt him in a violent and definitive manner, doing their best to kill him or knock him out before his spell is cast.

So one should think a bit before trying to save his game, lest this increases its risks instead of reducing them.

Mostly to be used in a single player context.
