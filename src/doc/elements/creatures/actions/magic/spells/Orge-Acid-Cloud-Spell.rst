Acid Cloud Spell
................



Suggested In-Game Names
_______________________


This spell could be named:

 - fantasy setting: ``Acid Cloud`` (english) / ``Nuage d'acide`` (french)



Spell Effects 
_____________

Generates a kind of irritating yellow and green fog from the target point, inflicting recurring acid damages to all creatures in the area of effect, and decreasing the sight range.

The fog will scatter from that target point, its effects decreasing as its area will increase, until dissolving in ambient air.

Only available in the Mage path, preferably cast through an incantation, although possibly cast by gesture, with a penalty.
