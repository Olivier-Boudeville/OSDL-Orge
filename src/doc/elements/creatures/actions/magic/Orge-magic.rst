Kinds of Arcane Magic
---------------------

Many ways lead to arcane operations:

	- the ``Mage`` Path: spell casting, mostly based on Intelligence, marginally on Wisdom and Willpower
	
	- the ``Cleric`` Path: divinity calling, mostly based on Wisdom, marginally on Charisma and Willpower
	
	- the ``Bard`` Path: suggestion instilling, unleashing the powers of music and word, mostly based on Charisma, marginally on Intelligence and Willpower

.. comment Besides these paths, other ones (called *Minor Paths* by the practioners of the three paths already mentioned) exist, like alchemy, augur, omen, presage and divination, shamanism, hex, jinxes, betwiching, thaumaturgics, trance, voodoo, vampirism, sortilege.


Although each path uses its own vocabulary, actually all arcane operations are some sorts of Spell.



Spells

Spell Types
...........	

Some spells are directly combat-related, they are called *Battle Arcanes* (ex: lightning bolt).

Other spells are *Summoning Contacts*, whose role is to notify some very specific creatures to come to appear and, hopefully, to obey their summoner, since he is generally unable to control them directly.

Spells useful in other ways are called *Ascendant Changes* (ex : teleportation).



Spell Casting

General Principles of Spell Casting
___________________________________


	
Modus Operandi
**************


To cast a spell, a bridge must be established between the physical world and the arcanes, so that some transformations are triggered in the arcane world and alter back the physical one.

Correct transformations have the expected consequences in the physical world.

Usually, incorrect transformations are absurd, and do not lead to anything, apart exhausting the caster. Almost correct spells (including interrupted ones) and spells obtained from transformations of correct spells are the most dangerous, as they often yield unexpected if not unwanted outcomes. 

For example, some spells are known to be *reversible*, i.e. having opposite effects once either preceded by a reversing arcane prefix or having their symbol reversed.

Long-living arcane users are the ones that learned soon that they should better stick to the classical old-fashioned spells, and never stay in the same room as arcane researchers.


Spell Specification
*******************


A spell corresponds to a series of arcane symbols, which may convey a meaning and a power. There are different means of expressing a spell, see `Spell Casting Methods`.

Anybody is able to gather some arcane symbols, to combine them in series, and to express them in one way or another. 

However all meaningful series need to be expressed by a caster talented enough. Otherwise mana will be spent but no spell will be cast, as all arcane operations drain mana points from the spellcaster regardless of their success. It has been found that, in general, the more demanding a spell is, the more powerful its effects will be.

Thus each spell, to be cast, requires:

 - a conscious caster
 - able to perform magic, having enough mana points and arcane expertise
 - having selected the right symbols in the right order with an adequate timing
 


Spell Consumables
*****************


The main fuel for a spell is the mana accumulated by its caster. All creatures generates mana, at different speeds and with different holding capacities, but very few kwnow it, and still fewer make ever use of that.

Some spells need specific reagents, others will perform better with.

Besides some spells will be considerably easier to cast if the caster is not time-constrained.



Arcane Progress
***************


Experienced spellcasters discovered that practise allowed them to cast more spells, or more powerful ones, or both.

This corresponds to various arcane skills, improving the progress in:

 - an arcane path: Mage Path, Cleric Path, or Bard Path
 - a spellcasting method: `Incantations`_, `Gesture Spellcasting`_, `Rune Carving`_, `Bardic Verse`_, `Pure Mental SpellCasting`_
 - arcane development: `Mana Tank`_, `Chained Casts`_


Spell Power
***********


It seems to be closely related to the mana spent to cast it, and to the caster skill. 

A set of arcane symbols seem to help specifying the spell power, either absolutely (scale symbols) or in a relative manner (power modifiers, i.e. magnifying or reducing effects).


Spell Targets
*************


All spells have their effects originating from a given point (the caster) and materializing starting from a single point. 

Spells can be:

 - local: in this case they affect one specific target, which can be a location, a creature (opponent or not), or an object. If not specified, it will apply to the caster itself
 - group: they impact a set of close creatures, including the caster 
 - zonal: the spell will affect an area regardless of the possible targets in that zone. If not specified, the zone will be centered around the caster itself
 
Local and group spells tend to be a lot more powerful than zonal ones, because they can impact only a limited set of specific targets. 

On the other hand, zonal spells can affect any number of targets which happen to be in their zone of effect, and additionally no target will be able to use its arcane resistance against that spell.

The reason for that is quite simple: a zonal spell targets the environment itself, and creatures in the zone of effect just happen to experience the consequences of that spell, and not the spell itself. However a zonal spell can be subjected to Counterspells_.

As there is no direct interaction between the spell and them, their arcane resistance is not involved. However other resistances might step in: for example, if a (zonal) Path Of Fire is cast, all creatures impacted will have to use at least their Fire resistance.



Spell Duration
**************

Once successfully cast, punctual spells trigger their effects and vanish, whereas durable spells lasts for some time.



Spell Range
***********

If all targeted spells trigger by default their effect on their caster, some targeted spells are able to be directed to other elements (location, objects or creatures) instead. Zonal spells can also be cast to different locations than the one of their caster.

Each time a spell is not directed on its caster, it will be harder to cast, as such, and because of the extended difficulty the operation implies to cover that range.

 
 
Counterspells
*************


These spells allow to remove or shorten effects of already cast durable spells. Counterspells must be cast immediately after the spell they try to act against.



Spell Casting Methods
*********************


Incantations
::::::::::::

Generally, spells are cast thanks to an incantation, which consists on the strong and clear declamation of the verbal transcription of the series of arcane symbols corresponding to that spell. However arcane powers are based on mental operations, and uttering is only one way among others of casting a spell.

Incantation is the approach favored notably by Humans, Elves and some Goblinoid arcane users. Its advantages are obvious:

 - this is one of the simplest and most effective ways of creating a link with the arcanes
 - spells loudly uttered by impressive mages tend to benefit from a certain psychological impact on opponents. Some wizards made even most of their reputation thanks to their arcane shows
 - although during an incantation casters are not able to defend themselves (even less to attack anybody directly), they can however (with some arcane penalty) still hold objects in their hands; thus once the incantation is over, they can be immediately able to act with the held objects, without incurring the time penalty corresponding to, say, draw their weapons 
 
The main drawbacks of incantations are well-known:

 - they can be hardly silent, so in general all the neighbourhood is aware of the ongoing process, and often tries to stop it by any (violent) means
 - they tend to last for a while (up to a few seconds), increasing the probability of interruptions
 - they depend heavily on the uttering capacity of the caster. Coughing, sneezing, or being drunk are prohibited, and any apprentice whose `Stammering`_ or, worst, `Dyslexia`_ tendencies are detected is immediately expelled, for obvious security reasons



If the caster is not time-constrained, meditations and rituals can ease his incantations.

The Mage Path and the Cleric Path rely a lot on Incantations, although their incantations differ widely.

Often clerics hold liturgic symbols like crosses or ankhs to reinforce their power, although of course they have to use one free hand for that.



Gesture Spellcasting
::::::::::::::::::::

With this approach, the arcane user recreates the spell with a series of gestures, executed by its two hands or, rarely, with only one hand.

Compared to incantations, there are real advantages in doing so:

 - it makes stealth spellcasting more possible
 - spellcasting itself tends to be quicker and, according to some sources, more reliable (an ongoing controversy is reported on that point)

However this comes at the cost of:

 - technical difficulty: this form of magic is certainly harder than Incantations for most species
 - hands must remain free, which prohibits the caster to hold weapons or shields; then this caster is especially vulnerable on the battlefield


Gesture Spellcasting is the natural way of using arcane powers for Gnome. Other species are seldom comfortable with this approach, except some Humans who make uses of staffs to improve the upstroke of their gesture.

The Mage Path is the only one to rely on Gesture Spellcasting. 



Rune Carving
::::::::::::

Whereas Incantations and Gesture Spellcasting can be performed in real-time (ex: during fights), Rune Carving is a lengthy yet quite reliable operation that must be prepared: the series of arcane symbols must be carefully engraved on a material. On completion, spells are triggered. These are usually long-lasting spells, i.e. enchantments.

Due to this nature, this arcane link is mostly used to enchant objects, including jewels (pendants, necklaces, rings, crowns, etc.), armors and weapons.

Dwarves are renowed in Rune Carving, and the effects of their work are powerful and long-lasting, but it has been discovered that Goblins and some categories of Orcs had some practise too. It is said that unlike dwarves, they make sometimes use of living elements in their carving process, including blood of the caster and sacrified beings, to enhance the spell or alter its effects. 

Some strange tattoos and ritual scarifications have been noticed on some corpses of most underground sentient creatures, without proof they had an effect on the creature underneath.

The Cleric Path, and, to a lesser extent, the Mage Path, rely a lot on Rune Carving. Clerics often bless or curse items.



Bardic Verse
::::::::::::

Because poetry and ballads do not deal blows, its is unfairly despised by many. However a well-interpreted bardic verse, either only sung, or accompanied with an instrument, can have tremendous yet different effects on allies and opponents as well: whereas the former will have their willpower reinforced and their mental fatigue alleviated, opponents will be prone to desillusion, fear and desertion.

Moreover, all beings in the area (i.e. opponents, allies, and the caster himself) will suffer from Sonic damages. 

This form of arcane operation is still considered weak, but if its effects have less direct impact during battle, they can affect numerous opponents while letting the caster making use of one-hand weapons (with a penalty though).

Between fights, verses can soothe physical and psychological wounds, help allies resting or opponents being put on sleep.

The Bard Path is of course the main path to rely on bardic verses, although clerics can from time to time sing ballads in honour of their deities. 



Pure Mental SpellCasting
::::::::::::::::::::::::

Some elite spellcasters are said to be able to perform Pure Mental SpellCasting, i.e. spellcasting only thanks to a mental process, involving no special movement (but huge penalties). This is a very unusual form of magic.

Very little information about these casters is known, quite presumably because the creatures able to do so must be very few, and because this technics results in an almost total discretion.

It is said that Pure Mental Casters are either Gnomes or Elves. Public knowledge is unsure about Humans. 

They are supposed to serve only the Mage Path, but suspect miracles seem to have occurred after clerics, according to their sayings, had made intense silent prayers.



Practical Spellcasting
**********************

Lost mana points can be regained:

 - at a low pace, when enough time has elapsed, with significant bonuses obtained when resting or, still more, when meditating (for Mages), praying (for Clerics) or improvising (for Bards)
 
 - in special places filled with magic (ex: some temples)
 
 - with specific elixirs or spells targeted by other magical users
 

The casting then may fail or succeed, on the emitter side, depending notably of the capacities of its caster. Most targeted spells require the caster to be on eye contact with their target.
  
Once successfully cast, a spell may fail or succeed, depending on the context. In all cases the mana is spent.

Some spells can be combined between multiple casters, so that their effect is stronger.

When a non-zonal spell succeeds, any targeted character will be able to try to resist to that spell, using their Arcane Resistance.

When some zonal spells succeed, targeted character may be able to try to resist to the *effects* of that spell, using the appropriate resistance (ex: Sonic Resistance against a Sonic Blast).



Wizard Path
:::::::::::


Cleric Path
:::::::::::


Clerics are warrior-priests. They can call on wide range of different gods and saints, each with a unique personality. They can serve only one god or a pantheon.

The divine powers they may received come at a cost: service, devotion and loyalty.

They prefer subdueing their foe rather than killing them. If however they happen to have to murder a character, then they can dedicate this death to a deity of their choice - some appreciate it.



Bard Path
:::::::::




Spell Outcome
*************


Spell Successfully Cast
:::::::::::::::::::::::

Once a spell has been successfully cast, impacted creatures might be able to react (see `Reactions`_), i.e. to try to escape from its effects, if wanted.

For example, a creature may want to try to dodge a Fireball, escape from an Icy Rain spell, but few tries to avoid a Protecting Aura. 

If the reaction succedeed, they will not be affected by the spell. On the contrary, the spell effects will be applied to them, and then damage resistance(s) will step in (see `Damage Resistance`_).


Spell Failure
:::::::::::::

Should a spell fail, on most cases nothing special will happen, spell will just fizzle.

On other cases, it may backfire, and deal damages, especially on the caster.

On rare cases, with some spells, the failure might result in various unwanted effects, immediately apparent or not.
