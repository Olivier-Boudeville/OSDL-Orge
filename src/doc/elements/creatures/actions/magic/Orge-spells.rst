Spells
------

All forms of actual magic is some kind of spell, not depending and what it does or how it was cast.


Spell Types
...........	

Some spells are directly combat-related, they are called *Battle Arcanes* (ex: lightning bolt).

Other spells are *Summoning Contacts*, whose role is to notify some very specific creatures to come to appear and, hopefully, to obey their summoner, since he is generally unable to control them directly.

Spells that are part of the dialogue between a belieer and a superior being are called *Deity Intercession*.

Spells useful in other ways are often called *Ascendant Changes* (ex : teleportation).



Spell Specification
*******************

A spell corresponds to a series of arcane symbols, which may convey a meaning and a power. There are different means of expressing a spell, see `Spell Casting Methods`.

Anybody is able to gather some arcane symbols, to combine them in series, and to express them in one way or another. 

However all meaningful series need to be expressed by a caster talented enough. Otherwise mana will be spent but no spell will be cast, as all arcane operations drain mana points from the spellcaster regardless of their success. It has been found that, in general, the more demanding a spell is, the more powerful its effects will be.

Thus each spell, to be cast, requires:

 - a conscious caster
 - able to perform magic, having enough mana points and arcane expertise
 - having selected the right symbols in the right order with an adequate timing



Spell Consumables
*****************

The main fuel for a spell is the mana accumulated by its caster. All creatures generates mana, at different speeds and with different holding capacities, but very few kwnow it, and still fewer make ever use of that.

The mana capacity of a creature regenerates over time, especially when it sleeps.

Some spells need specific reagents (ex: a hair of the target of a spell), others will perform better with (ex: using mandragore roots can enhance the effect of some antidotes).

Besides some spells will be considerably easier to cast if the caster is not time-constrained.



Spell Power
***********

It seems to be closely related to the mana spent to cast it, and to the caster skill. 

A set of arcane symbols seem to help specifying the spell power, either absolutely (scale symbols) or in a relative manner (power modifiers, i.e. magnifying or reducing effects).



Spell Targets
*************

All spells have their effects originating from a given point (the caster) and materializing starting from a single point, the target, which by default is the caster. 

Spells can be:

 - local: in this case they affect one specific target, which can be a location, a creature (opponent or not), or an object. If not specified, it will apply to the caster itself; casting a spell aimed at a target rather than at the caster induces a penalty in its probability of success (+5% risks of failure) and in its mana cost (+8%)
 
 - group: they impact a set of close creatures, generally including the caster; group spells are far less common than local and zonal spells
  
 - zonal: the spell will affect an area regardless of the possible targets in that zone. If not specified, the zone will be centered around the caster itself; the area of effect of a zonal spell is located at the actual target point, and its shape and surface depend on the spell and on how it was cast 
 
 - contextual: some spells may modify the full game context; they can seldom be used in a multiplayer game (ex: the "pause game" spell)
 
Local and group spells tend to be a lot more powerful than zonal ones, because they can impact only a limited set of specific targets. 

On the other hand, zonal spells can affect any number of targets which happen to be in their zone of effect, and additionally no target will be able to use its arcane resistance against that spell.

The reason for that is quite simple: a zonal spell targets the environment itself, and creatures in the zone of effect just happen to experience the consequences of that spell, and not the spell itself. However a zonal spell can be subjected to Counterspells_.

As there is no direct interaction between the spell and them, their arcane resistance is not involved. However other resistances might step in: for example, if a (zonal) Path Of Fire is cast, all creatures impacted will have to use at least their Fire resistance.



Spell Duration
**************

Once successfully cast, punctual spells trigger their effects and vanish, whereas durable spells lasts for some time. All known spells are time-bound.



Spell Range
***********

If all targeted spells trigger by default their effect on their caster, some targeted spells are able to be directed to other elements (location, objects or creatures) instead. Zonal spells can also be cast to different locations than the one of their caster.

Each time a spell is not directed on its caster, it will be harder to cast, as such, and because of the extended difficulty the operation implies to cover that range.

 
 
Counterspells
*************


These spells allow to remove or shorten effects of already cast durable spells. Counterspells must be cast immediately after the spell they try to act against.



Spell Outcome
*************


Spell Successfully Cast
:::::::::::::::::::::::

Once a spell has been successfully cast, impacted creatures might be able to react (see `Reactions`_), i.e. to try to escape from its effects, if wanted.

For example, a creature may want to try to dodge a Fireball, escape from an Icy Rain spell, but few tries to avoid a Protecting Aura. 

If the reaction succedeed, they will not be affected by the spell. On the contrary, the spell effects will be applied to them, and then damage resistance(s) will step in (see `Damage Resistance`_).


Spell Failure
:::::::::::::


Having enough mana, having the right reagents and knowing how the spell should be cast is not sufficient: the wizard must also have enough magical skills so that the spell can succeed. Even if all these prerequisites are satisfied, a small risk of failure still exists.

Should a spell fail, on most cases nothing special will happen, spell will just fizzle.

On other cases, it may backfire, and deal damages, especially on the caster.

On rare cases, with some spells, the failure might result in various unwanted effects, immediately apparent or not.
