Spellcasting

General Principles of Spell Casting
___________________________________


	
Modus Operandi
**************

To cast a spell, a bridge must be established between the physical world and the arcanes, so that some transformations are triggered in the arcane world and alter back the physical one.

Correct transformations have the expected consequences in the physical world.

Usually, incorrect transformations are absurd, and do not lead to anything, apart exhausting the caster. Almost correct spells (including interrupted ones) and spells obtained from transformations of correct spells are the most dangerous, as they often yield unexpected if not unwanted outcomes. 

For example, some spells are known to be *reversible*, i.e. having opposite effects once either preceded by a reversing arcane prefix or having their symbol reversed.

Long-living arcane users are the ones that learned soon that they should better stick to the classical old-fashioned spells, and never stay in the same room as arcane researchers.



Spell Casting Methods
*********************

There are five main methods to cast a spell: 

 - Incantations
 - Gesture SpellCasting
 - Rune Carving
 - Bardic Verse
 - Pure Mental SpellCasting

Usually a given spell can only by cast with a few of these methods, if not only one of them.

Notably the ``Rune Carving`` and ``Bardic Verse`` spellcasting methods each support only a relatively small set of very specific spells, and these spells in general could not be cast thanks to any other approach. 

Therefore most wizards, once having selected the arcane path(s) they want to follow, not only invest on skills directly relative to that path (ex: they might increase their ``Magery`` skills if having selected the Mage Path), but also on ``Arcane Technics`` skills, i.e. on skills dedicated to a spell casting method that corresponds to the path and spells they want to favor. 

For example, if wanting to be able to cast high-end fireballs (obviously in the Mage path), then a wizard should increase its skills in spell casting methods that can apply to fireballs, like Incantations or Gesture SpellCasting, rather than Bardic Verse.



Incantations Spellcasting
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

Generally, spells are cast thanks to an incantation, which consists on the strong and clear declamation of the verbal transcription of the series of arcane symbols corresponding to that spell. However arcane powers are based on mental operations, and uttering is only one way among others of casting a spell.

Incantation is the approach favored notably by Humans, Elves and some Goblinoid arcane users. Its advantages are obvious:

 - this is one of the simplest and most effective ways of creating a link with the arcanes
 - spells loudly uttered by impressive mages tend to benefit from a certain psychological impact on opponents. Some wizards made even most of their reputation thanks to their arcane shows
 - although during an incantation casters are not able to defend themselves (even less to attack anybody directly), they can however (with some arcane penalty) still hold objects in their hands; thus once the incantation is over, they can be immediately able to act with the held objects, without incurring the time penalty corresponding to, say, draw their weapons 
 
The main drawbacks of incantations are well-known:

 - they can be hardly silent, so in general all the neighbourhood is aware of the ongoing process, and often tries to stop it by any (violent) means
 
 - they tend to last for a while (up to a few seconds), increasing the probability of interruptions
 
 - they depend heavily on the uttering capacity of the caster. Coughing, sneezing, or being drunk are prohibited, and any apprentice whose `Stammering`_ or, worst, `Dyslexia`_ tendencies are detected is immediately expelled, for obvious security reasons


If the caster is not time-constrained, meditations and rituals can ease his incantations. In some case, rituals are strictly necessary.

The Mage Path and the Cleric Path rely a lot on Incantations, although their incantations differ widely.

Often clerics hold liturgic symbols like crosses or ankhs to reinforce their power, although of course they have to use one free hand for that.



Gesture Spellcasting
::::::::::::::::::::

With this approach, the arcane user recreates the spell with a series of gestures, executed by its two hands or, rarely, with only one hand.

Compared to incantations, there are real advantages in doing so:

 - it makes stealth spellcasting more possible
 
 - spellcasting itself tends to be quicker and, according to some sources, more reliable (an ongoing controversy is reported on that point)

However this comes at the cost of:

 - technical difficulty: this form of magic is certainly harder than incantations for most species
 
 - hands must remain free, which prohibits the caster to hold weapons or shields; then this caster is especially vulnerable on the battlefield


Gesture Spellcasting is the natural way of using arcane powers for Gnomes. Other species are seldom comfortable with this approach, except some Humans, who sometimes make uses of staffs to improve the upstroke of their gesture.

The Mage Path is the only one to rely on Gesture Spellcasting. 



Rune Carving
::::::::::::

Whereas Incantations and Gesture Spellcasting can be performed in real-time (ex: during fights), Rune Carving is a lengthy yet quite reliable operation that must be prepared: the series of arcane symbols must be carefully engraved or printed on a material (ex: horn, skin, metal, etc.). On completion, spells are triggered. These are usually long-lasting spells, i.e. enchantments.

Due to this nature, this arcane link is mostly used to enchant objects, including jewels (pendants, necklaces, rings, crowns, etc.), armors and weapons.

Dwarf Rune Carving is renowned, as the effects of their work are powerful and long-lasting, but it has been discovered that Goblins and some categories of Orcs had some practise too. It is said that unlike dwarves, they make sometimes use of living elements in their carving process, including blood of the caster and sacrified beings, to enhance the spell or alter its effects. 

Some strange tattoos and ritual scarifications have been noticed on some corpses of most underground sentient creatures, without proof they had an effect on the creature underneath.

The Cleric Path, and, to a lesser extent, the Mage Path, rely a lot on Rune Carving. Clerics often bless or curse items.



Bardic Verse
::::::::::::

Because poetry and ballads do not deal blows, its is unfairly despised by many. 

However a well-interpreted bardic verse, either only sung, or accompanied with 
an instrument, can have tremendous yet different effects on allies and opponents as well: for example, whereas the former will have their willpower reinforced and their mental fatigue alleviated, opponents will be prone to desillusion, fear and desertion.

Moreover, all beings in the area (i.e. opponents, allies, and the caster himself) may suffer from Sonic damages. 

This form of arcane operation is still considered weak, but if its effects have less direct impact during battle, they can affect numerous opponents while letting the caster making use of weapons (with penalties, though).

Indeed most spells cast through bardic verse will have for implicit target the members of the caster's party that are in hearing range, as the recitation will be aimed directly to them, talking only to their spirit and to their heart.

Between fights, verses can soothe physical and psychological wounds, help allies resting or opponents being put on sleep.

The Bard Path is of course the main path to rely on bardic verses, although clerics can from time to time sing ballads to celebrate their deities. 



Pure Mental SpellCasting
::::::::::::::::::::::::

Some elite spellcasters are said to be able to perform Pure Mental SpellCasting, i.e. spellcasting only thanks to a mental process, involving no special movement (but huge penalties). This is a very unusual form of magic.

Very little information about these casters is known, quite presumably because the creatures able to do so must be very few, and because this technics results in an almost total discretion.

It is said that Pure Mental Casters are either Gnomes or Elves. Public knowledge is unsure about Humans. 

They are supposed to serve only the Mage Path, but suspect miracles seem to have occurred after clerics, according to their sayings, had made intense silent prayers.



Practical Spellcasting
**********************

Lost mana points can be regained:

 - at a low pace, when enough time has elapsed, with significant bonuses obtained when resting (including sleeping) or, still more, when meditating (for Mages), praying (for Clerics) or improvising (for Bards)
 
 - in special places filled with magic (ex: some temples)
 
 - with specific elixirs or spells targeted by other magical users
 

The casting then may fail or succeed, on the emitter side, depending notably of the capacities of its caster. Most targeted spells require the caster to be on eye contact with their target.
  
Once successfully cast, a spell may fail or succeed, depending on the context. In all cases the mana is spent.

Some spells can be combined between multiple casters, so that their effect is stronger.

When a non-zonal spell succeeds, any targeted character will be able to try to resist to that spell, using their Arcane Resistance.

When some zonal spells succeed, targeted character may be able to try to resist to the *effects* of that spell, using the appropriate resistance (ex: *Sonic Resistance* against a *Sonic Blast*). 

Finally, some spells can be *chained*: an ice bolt can branch into more bolts, fireballs may bounce and split, buffs (enchantments for temporary creature enhancement) may be triggered in sequences.





How to improve Spellcasting
***************

Experienced spellcasters discovered that practise allowed them to cast more spells, or more powerful ones, or both.

This corresponds to various arcane skills, improving the progress in:

 - an arcane path: Mage Path, Cleric Path, or Bard Path
 - a spellcasting method: `Incantations`_, `Gesture Spellcasting`_, `Rune Carving`_, `Bardic Verse`_, `Pure Mental SpellCasting`_
 - arcane development: `Mana Tank`_, `Chained Casts`_
