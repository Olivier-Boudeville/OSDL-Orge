Spell Repository
----------------

For each spell, following informations are given:

 - the **Orge canonical spell name** : this acts as an identifier for Orge designers only, it is not chosen to be chosen in-game (ex: the ``Save Game`` spell); used as the title of the section dedicated to that spell 
 
 - the suggested **in-game spell names**: this is a list of possible in-game names for that spell, depending on the settings of that game (ex: ``Norn Contemplation`` for a medieval RPG, ``Memory Cristal Filling`` for a cyberpunk one, etc.); translations to various languages can be given as well

 - full textual description of the **spell effects**
 
 - **spell characteristics**, with eligible targets, area of effects, duration, cost in terms of reagents (if any) and mana
 
 - rules to determine the **probability of success of the casting**

A template for spell description is available in ``Orge-spell-template.rst``.
