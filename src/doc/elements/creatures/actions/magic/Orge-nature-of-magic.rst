Nature of Magic
---------------

Magic is everywhere, present in each and every creature and material, and generated over time by all life forms.

It is based on a higher-order energy, called the Mana, that can be consumed and converted to other kinds of energy. 

Magic can be to some extent controlled and channeled by some creatures, from the Arcanes to the world that living creatures experience.

This energy seems to resist formalization and analysis, and still cannot be considered as being mastered at all by any scientific effort. However some generic empirical rules have been discovered and taught from a generation of magic users to the next.

Notably there are constants that can be found in most forms of magic: whether you utter a spell, perform arcane gestures, play and sing bardic music, or write runes, you are manipulating a series of symbols that seem to have a shared meaning, beyond the mode of operation, i.e. the actual way they are brought to existence.

For example wizards of various parts of the world were found to cast similar spells, although they were each uttering incantations formulated with words from their own particular language, as if, beyond words, magic was actually triggered by meaning or, more precisely, by the mental mechanisms that were triggered in the caster's mind.

Any underlying language is still to be decyphered and, before ever studying its syntax and grammar, knowing whether it is based on some kind of arcane alphabet would be a tremendous progress indeed.

Some theories assume that a spell is made of a series of symbols, each being built out a set of keys, a bit like Kanji ideograms.

Anyway, only very few combinations of magical symbols seem to make sense. Unless appropriate mentors or wizard's books of spells are found, most wizard wanabees will end up in proceeding by trial and error, which is both frustrating and risky. Players are expected to build up their own spell books.
