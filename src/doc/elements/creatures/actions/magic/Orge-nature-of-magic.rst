Nature of Magic
---------------

Magic, which belongs to the Arcane realm, is everywhere, present in each and every creature and material, and generated over time by all life forms.

It is based on a higher-order energy, called the Mana, that cannot be harnessed directly in the physical world, but that can be consumed and converted to other classical types of energy instead. 

Magic can be to some extent controlled and channeled by some creatures, from the Arcanes, its natural place, to the world that living creatures experience.

This energy still resists formalization and analysis, and cannot be considered as being mastered at all by any known scientific effort. However some generic empirical rules have been discovered and taught from a generation of magic users to the next.

Notably there are some constants that can be found in most forms of magic: whether you utter a spell, perform arcane gestures, play and sing bardic music, or write runes, you are manipulating a series of symbols that seem to have a shared meaning not depending on the mode of operation, i.e. on the actual magical way they are brought to existence.

For example wizards of various parts of the world were found to cast similar spells, although they were each uttering incantations formulated with words from their own particular language, as if, beyond words, magic was actually triggered by meaning or, more precisely, by the mental mechanisms that were triggered in the caster's mind.

Any underlying language is still to be decyphered. Before ever studying its syntax and grammar, knowing whether it is based on some kind of arcane alphabet would be a tremendous progress indeed.

Some theories assume that a spell is made of a series of symbols, each being built out of a set of keys, a bit like Kanji ideograms.

Anyway, only very few combinations of magical symbols seem to make sense. Unless appropriate mentors or wizard's books of spells are found [#]_, most wizard wanabees will end up proceeding by trial and error, which is both frustrating and risky. 

.. [#] This is not so common, as sadly magic users tend to be very reluctant to share their knowledge and findings.

Apprentices are expected to build up their own spell books, and to make due use of it.
