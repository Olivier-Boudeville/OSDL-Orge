Species Contextual Influences
-----------------------------




Time Of Day
...........


The day/night alternation has an impact on a lot of creatures.

Knowing that noon is midday (12:00) and midnight is 24:00, a day can be divided evenly in four periods during which all creatures of a species have bonus or malus regarding the probability of success of each of their actions.

For all creatures, the sum of bonus and malus during 24 hours should be null.

Some species are diurnal (Humans, Elves, Halflings), some others are nocturnal (Dwarves,Goblins,Orcs), and a few have no real preference (Gnome and, to a less extent, Halflings).

Dwarves prefer the morning to the evening.


.. Note:: These modifiers deal with the time of day, not with the daylight. Thus they should apply even underground. See: `Lighting`_ instead.

Lighting
........


Reactions to lighting respect roughly the diurnal/noctural ways of life (ex: Humans and Orcs have mirrored needs), although some species like the Elves can undergo a wide range of light intensity with little effect. Gnome and Goblins prefer intermediate lights to more contrasted ones.

Environment Modifiers
.....................


The surrounding overall environment of a character induces for most species a difference in their ability to perform actions. For example, gnomes are well-known for their claustrophobic tendencies.

Environment modifiers should not be confused with `Terrain Modifiers`_, which apply mainly to combats and movements, and are far more local.

.. [#] See `Primary Attributes`_ for a detailed description of these attributes. A species having ``STR-5`` for example means that all creatures from that species suffer from a 5% malus in strength, compared to the Human species.
