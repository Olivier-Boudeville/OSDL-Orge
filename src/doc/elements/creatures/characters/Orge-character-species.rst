Species
-------

In Orge *Species* is preferred to *Races*. No special distinction is made between sentient, intelligent, advanced creatures, animals, monsters, etc. They are all creatures of various species.


List Of Built-in Orge Species
............................

There are seven of them:

+-------------+-------------------------------------------+
| Species     | Description                               |
|             |                                           |
|             |                                           |
+=============+===========================================+
| Human       | Human like us, back in Medieval Times.    |
|             | All other species are defined compared to |
|             | humans, which is probably the most        |
|             | versatile species.                        |
+-------------+-------------------------------------------+
| Elf         | Long-lived humanoid creatures of great    |
|             | beauty living mostly in forests. Looking  |
|             | frail, they are gifted in arcane powers.  |
|             | Leaf-shaped hears. Not so trustworthy.    |
|             |                                           |
+-------------+-------------------------------------------+
| Dwarf       | Strong, sturdy, bold humanoid creatures.  |
|             | Among the worst magical users. Talented   |
|             | for technical operations, rather          |
|             | long-lived, heavy, and vertically         |
|             | prejudiced. Really naughty with an axe.   |
|             | Incredibly enduring. Very loyal, but      |
|             | quite touchy (limited sense of humour).   |
+-------------+-------------------------------------------+
| Halfling    | Half the size of a human, but still quite |
|             | strong, they are quick, silent, most would|
|             | be good thieves, few are so inclined.     |
|             | Neither attracted nor too affected by     |
|             | magic.                                    |
+-------------+-------------------------------------------+
| Gnome       | This humanoid is very small and adopts    |
|             | often a subterranean lifestyle.           |
|             | Males are bearded. Rather benevolent, and |
|             | fond of the wildlife, their high          |
|             | intelligence makes them powerful magic    |
|             | users, notably to craft magic items.      |
|             | They tend to underestimate how irritating |
|             | their taunt can become in a party.        |
+-------------+-------------------------------------------+
| Goblin      | Ill-tempered evil creature whose size is  |
|             | roughly the one of Dwarves. They are      |
|             | nomadic, gregarious, and especially sly.  |
|             | Recurrent allies of Orc, although often   |
|             | considered by them as battle fodder.      |
|             | Some of them perform a magic of their own.|
|             | Excellent perception, notably olfactory,  |
|             | although the creature itself stinks.      |
|             | Several subspecies exist, like the Kobold |
|             | and the HobGoblins.                       |
+-------------+-------------------------------------------+
| Orc         | Evil, humanoid creature, as large as a    |
|             | Human, dreaded for its aggressiveness and |
|             | combat skills. Ugly, filthy, with a taste |
|             | for all manner of flesh and a strong      |
|             | hatred of Elves. They are often directed  |
|             | by a stronger will, and their deadly      |
|             | attacks occur generally at night.         |
+-------------+-------------------------------------------+


Other species can be added by the GM, either fully original or based on the built-in species (ex: half-elves, or half-orcs, etc.)
