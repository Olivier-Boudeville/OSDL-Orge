Social Organizations
====================


Guilds
------

A lot of guilds are geared towards specific sectors of activity, and therefore correspond quite closely to character classes.


Thieves'Guild
.............

One of the most proeminent and successful guilds: almost every town has it local thieves headquarters, although it is in generally very well concealed from the rest of the population.


Brotherhood Of St.Urquhart
..........................

This monastic community lives apart from secular society, usually in rather large complex of buildings around an abbey. Monks of St.Urquhart are reputed for their hand-to-hand combat technics, and for their focus on group combat.


Order Of Aasgard Knights
........................

Often set on the borders of town or in the wilderness, they take take the form of commanderies. Around an often well-fortified  manor are dispatched a series of stables, training yards, houses and fields.


Circle Of Arcane Rulers
.......................

This ancient guild has for particularity to gather all schoolds of wizardry, although they are known to be hardly able to live together. This guild tends to decline, due to the progress of organizations dedicated to specific schools of magic.

The premises of Arcane Rulers are often near the center of towns, in beautiful buildings, but lacking of repairs, if not already in noticeable decay.

A large number of local circles still have a functional teleportation portal.




Rookie / Freshman (Novice) / Apprentice (Untrained) / Trained / Seasoned / Veteran / Master / Elite.

Police

Towns are protected by different kinds of police forces, in general efficient and with numerous agents.

When a character is arrested (regardless of the reality of his bad deeds), the character risks various displeasures, from the Court Hall to the immediate killing.

Police can be seen as well as a specific guild.
