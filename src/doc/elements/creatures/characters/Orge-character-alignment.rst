Alignment
---------

Alignment is not chosen as such by the controller of a creature: it just results from its beliefs, choices and actions.

Alignment is thus considered in Orge as a minor indicator. 

For the vast majority of creatures, it is overshadowed by reputation, as these creatures cannot see directly in the system of values of a target character, and therefore can only rely on observation and reputation. On the other hand, Gods rely on alignment, a major concern for characters having elected the Cleric profession. 

Alignment is useful though for telepaths and, more importantly, deities, which can check to which extent their followers respect their expected approach to life.


In Orge, alignment is determined quite classically from two measures:

 - a **moral** balance, which ranges continuously from good to evil:
 
	1. *good*: compassion and search for the common good
	2. *neutral*: selfishness and lack of interest for others
	3. *evil*: taste for the suffering of others
 
 - a **psychosocial** balance, which ranges continuously from lawful to chaotic:
 
	1. *lawful*: loyal, reliable, rational, stable, logical, having respect for all kinds of rules, but also dull, predictable, narrow-minded, unimaginative 
	2. *neutral*: balanced, but also indifferent or lacking the capacity to judge
	3. *chaotic*: original, free, surprising, creative, but also offensive, changing, untrustworthy, disturbing, contradictory, disorderly, arbitrary
	
See also the  nine combinations, as detailed this Wikipedia `article <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)#Alignments>`_, in the rather close context of *Dungeons & Dragons*.
	
Good and evil characters cannot join the same party.
