Character Creation
------------------

If the player is given the ability of customize the characteristics of a creature she controls, she will have in most cases a budget (expressed in Character Points) to spend on Primary Attributes, Associated Attributes (including Age), Skills and Traits.

More precisely, all settings listed in `Creature Characterization`_ will have to be defined:

 - `Gender`_
 - `History`_
 - `Persona`_ (personality traits), ex: hot tempered, arrogant, coward, roguish, etc.
 - `Primary Attributes`_: it is recommended that on creation, most if not all attributes of an adult creature are in the 4-20 range 


Age vs Skills Trade-Off
.......................

The player might prefer to create a middle-aged character (thus having decreased actual statistics, including lifespan) who would compensate with augmented skills. Sometimes relying on a trained thief is safer than to bet on a promising yet unexperienced burglar.

Some professions (ex: soldier) require usually that characters are trained for some years (ex: for 16 to 20-year-old) before being acknowledged competent for a certain rank (see `Military Ranks`_).


Initial Possessions
...................

This is story-specific. GM should avoid starting too high or unrealistically too low.

This should include at least:

 - some clothing, and maybe lightweight armor
 - some tools that might be used as poor weapons as well (ex: knife, pickaxe, etc.)
 - the character's starting money
 - maybe some family valuables the character may have to sell
 
 
 
Species Initial Skills
......................


Unless mentioned otherwise (i.e. unless the creature had an atypic history), a creature of a given species and age will master at least a minimal list of skills, resulting from its cultural integration and training.
