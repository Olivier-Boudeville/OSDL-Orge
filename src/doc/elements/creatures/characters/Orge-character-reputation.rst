Reputation
----------

Reputation is a far more interesting indicator than (intrinsic) alignment, as the latter is seldom known outside the character, and has little use in interactions: they deal mostly with the appearance rather than with the essence.

Reputation corresponds to the alignment of a character, as *perceived* by third-parties. It depends mostly on the character's history, sayings and actings, and by whom and where it is evaluated.


Factions
........

A simplistic reputation system can be obtained with the management of *factions*, which store the fact that a character acted for, or against, a category of characters.

For example, when slaughtering the member of a strongly united community, these systems make the community as a whole turn against the murderer.

The main regret is that these systems do not take into account the fact that they may or may not be witnesses. Bad deeds not seen should affect alignments, but not reputations.

Means of Influencing a Reputation
.................................

Be it the character's own reputation or the one of another character, there are other ways to influence it than by direct action. 


Spreading Rumours
_________________

These rumours may be for or, more often, against, a character. Their success depends mainly of the likeliness of the rumour and on the character's reputation and charisma.


Hiring a Bard
_____________

One can use the services of a bard, in order to write and interpret songs conveying a certain message.

This includes:

 - secret (cryptic) messages, targeting any accomplice in the audience
 
 - panegyrics, to enhance the reputation of someone, quite often the silent partner itself
 
 - satiristic songs, to deplete reputations (rarely the one of the backer, obviously)

Efficient bards are quite expensive though and, if seduced, tortured or bribed, may reveal the name of their employer.
