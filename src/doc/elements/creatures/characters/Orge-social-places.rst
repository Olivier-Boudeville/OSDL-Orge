Social Places
=============


Towns
-----

These are the place where most commodities for characters in need can be found:

 - taverns offers drinks and meeting places, for example for over-the-counter quests, news exchanges or unofficial recruitment
 
 - banks allow to store character possessions relatively safely 
 
 - hospitals and clinics help restoring health and recovering from wounds and diseases
 
 - inns offer a place to sleep quietly, and to let party members left behind (not selected for a given action)
 
 - city hall and information panels give access to public services and offers (ex: openly published job offers)

 - stores offer thematically sorted goods, with often a good choice; merchants are often difficult in bargaining
 
 - markets are ideal for haggling second-hand properties, if one does not fear to have its purse stolen

 - mainstream guilds have local premises, secret or not, in most towns
 
 - religious places, like churches, temples, etc., help accommodating with one's deity, if any
 
 - dormitories and boarding schools
 
 - graveyard: crypts, tombs and graves
 
Towns are also a place of choice for *safe* social interactions, as combats are expected to be banned there.
